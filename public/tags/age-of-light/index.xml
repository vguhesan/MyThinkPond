      <description>#AgeOfLight
 As I was reading today&amp;rsquo;s news (Science) breakthroughs, I came across two independent discovery/invention but combined makes a HUGE breakthrough and paves the way for a BIGHTER FUTURE!!!
If this peeks your interest read further.
[#1] Invention: Manufacturing Graphene using Tea-Extract
What problem does this solve? Today, manufacturing Graphene takes a lot of time and can only produce/grow small amounts of the material. It takes a lot of energy, raw-material and time - to produce the small quantities of the product.</description>
