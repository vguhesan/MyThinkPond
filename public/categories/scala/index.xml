      <description>Sometimes when compiling my Scala code, the compiler output may need a little bit of help in sorting out what&amp;rsquo;s the real issue.
For example, when I compiled today I received the following error:
[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;jscript&amp;rdquo;]
[scalac] error: error while loading DefaultHttpClient, class file &amp;lsquo;C:\A_OpenSource\WicketNotesApp\lib\httpclient-4.0.jar(org/apache/http/impl/client/DefaultHttpClient.class)&amp;rsquo; is broken scalac
[scalac] error: error while loading AbstractHttpClient, class file &amp;lsquo;C:\A_OpenSource\WicketNotesApp\lib\httpclient-4.0.jar(org/apache/http/impl/client/AbstractHttpClient.class)&amp;rsquo; is broken scalac
[/sourcecode]
And my instinct tells me to focus on the jar file or the class file and in this case, &amp;ldquo;DefaultHttpClient.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need to forward to a servlet or resource that&amp;rsquo;s outside of Wicket such as a servlet. Here&amp;rsquo;s how:
 Modify your web.xml to define your servlet as well as your Wicket application &amp;ldquo;ignorePaths&amp;rdquo; init-param:  [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;xml&amp;rdquo;] &amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;ldquo;1.0&amp;rdquo; encoding=&amp;ldquo;UTF-8&amp;rdquo;?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC &amp;ldquo;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  Wicket Example  MyApplication org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter  applicationClassName com.gu.MyApplication   wicket.configuration deployment   ignorePaths images/,s/    MyApplication /*   SomeServlet com.</description>

      <title>ContextPath in Apache Wicket</title>

      <description>One of the first things I found as I was getting familiar with Wicket is how do you point to resources that are part of a page. Well I did some digging around to find out so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting it here for others who might be facing the same challenges as they discover Apache Wicket.
Problem: You have pages in Wicket that are HTML with &amp;ldquo;Wicket&amp;rdquo; tags. But then you might want to point to resources such as CSS style sheets or JavaScript that&amp;rsquo;s part of a page.</description>

      <title>First Date with IntelliJ Community Edition and Scala</title>
      <link>/2009/11/04/first-date-with-intellij-community-edition-and-scala/</link>

      <description>Downloaded the Community Edition of IntelliJ a few days ago. Although most J2EE features are not available in the community edition, one of the features that did like was the Scala Plugin.
After I downloaded it and added the scala plug-in, I was very impressed with the tool. I have been using Eclipse (a little Netbeans) for most of my Java development and although I have tried the scala plugin that&amp;rsquo;s available for Eclipse, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that impressed.</description>
