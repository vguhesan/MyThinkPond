      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re developing on a Windows platform for an application targeted for Linux or Unix that deals with email, then this article will be useful.
Let us begin by understand the problem.
Problem If you are a Java/Spring developer, (developing in Java is platform independent - runs on any platform where a JVM is available) then you have two options in front of you for sending emails from a Java application:</description>

      <description>Most likely you&amp;rsquo;ve landed on this page because you&amp;rsquo;ve searched for the error in a search engine and it brought you here.
Symptom: When you run &amp;ldquo;grails&amp;rdquo; under an existing project that you previously had (either on a different PC or from a source-control like GIT or SVN and you&amp;rsquo;ve mistakenly included the &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; directory).
The associated error would have been one of the following:

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re implementing any projects with Spring and Gradle (for build), as your project grows you may run into this issue. Or you&amp;rsquo;ve landed on this page by searching on Google for &amp;ldquo;Unable to locate Spring NamespaceHandler for XML schema namespace&amp;rdquo; (your actual XML that it&amp;rsquo;s error-ing out may vary).
Either way, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck! Most likely, you&amp;rsquo;re using the fatjar gradle plugin to create a single JAR for executing as &amp;ldquo;java -jar one-big-bundle.</description>

SEVERE: Error listenerStart
You will most likely start Googling it trying to find out what the heck is going on. And in trying to see the extended logging on what that &amp;ldquo;listenerStart&amp;rdquo; error means. After some lucky searches, you will see links asking you to drop a &amp;ldquo;log4j.</description>
