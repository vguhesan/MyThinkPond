      <description>Most likely you&amp;rsquo;ve landed on this page because you&amp;rsquo;ve searched for the error in a search engine and it brought you here.
Symptom: When you run &amp;ldquo;grails&amp;rdquo; under an existing project that you previously had (either on a different PC or from a source-control like GIT or SVN and you&amp;rsquo;ve mistakenly included the &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; directory).
The associated error would have been one of the following:
Grails No profile found for name [web] or java.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re implementing any projects with Spring and Gradle (for build), as your project grows you may run into this issue. Or you&amp;rsquo;ve landed on this page by searching on Google for &amp;ldquo;Unable to locate Spring NamespaceHandler for XML schema namespace&amp;rdquo; (your actual XML that it&amp;rsquo;s error-ing out may vary).
Either way, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck! Most likely, you&amp;rsquo;re using the fatjar gradle plugin to create a single JAR for executing as &amp;ldquo;java -jar one-big-bundle.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you have been developing with Java and Tomcat for sometime, you are likely to run into the infamous debug error.
SEVERE: Error listenerStart
You will most likely start Googling it trying to find out what the heck is going on. And in trying to see the extended logging on what that &amp;ldquo;listenerStart&amp;rdquo; error means. After some lucky searches, you will see links asking you to drop a &amp;ldquo;log4j.</description>
