Welcome to 'MyThinkPond". My name is Venkatt Guhesan. This pond is a collection of some useful, some useless knowledge I have collected over the years. And hence, "MyThinkPond". It contains my thoughts, ideas, comments and understanding of technology - especially Java, Scala, JVM, J2EE and some about random thoughts.


Some of my interests in Java and Scala are in finding the best ways to effectively couple various servlet-filter technologies with the new front-end web2.0 style front-ends and various back-end persistent storage/databases/repositories. Some of the servlet-filter technologies I work with are Spring Framework, Groovy, Grails, Vaadin, GWT, Struts2, Wicket, WebWork, XWork, Portal and plain old J2EE Servlet implementations. Some of the back-end persistent storage/databases/repositories that I focus on are SQL Server, MySQL (MariaDB), Postgresql, H2 Database, MongoDB, CouchDB, Hadoop (HDFS) and Memcached. Some of the front-end technologies that interest me are - JQuery, Dojo, ExtJS, GWT, Yahoo UI, Prototype and plain old HTML. I have always found it fascinating and challenging to find the right balance in use of these technologies to create a robust, scalable, secure solution that meets the needs of a web based application.


Some of my other passions are in Linux (CentOS, Red Hat, Gentoo, Open Stack, Docker & Ubuntu) and embedded processors (ARM processors and Microcontrollers). One of my favorite embedded projects includes the - [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), [UDOO](http://www.udoo.org/),Â  [Cubieboard](http://cubieboard.org/), [CuBox](http://www.solid-run.com/cubox), [BeagleBoard ](http://beagleboard.org/), TI's [Zigbee](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/111) and TI's [Piccolo Controlstick](http://focus.ti.com/mcu/docs/mcuprodtoolsw.tsp?sectionId=95&tabId=1222&familyId=916&toolTypeId=1). Coming from a Electrical and Computer Engineering background - all I can say is that "we are now living in the best times in human innovation and there is so much to learn and so little time."


I moved from Tamilnadu, India about twenty some years ago and I currently live in Maryland, USA with my family. At present, I work as an Enterprise UI Architect for [DataDirect Networks](http://www.ddn.com). I have been developing [DirectMon](http://www.ddn.com/products/storage-management-directmon), an Enterprise Monitoring and Management Solution for all of the DDN products. Before that I worked at [DrFirst](http://www.drfirst.com/e-prescribing-for-controlled-substances.jsp) engineering an e-prescribing platform for controlled substances. And before that I had spent over thirteen years at [Aon-Hewitt](http://www.aon.com/human-capital-consulting/benefits-admin/default.jsp) developing a premier suite of solutions for Human Resource and Benefits Management under the name RealLifeBenefits. I have worked in Finance, Investing, Mutual Fund Management, Insurance, Health Care, Rx Management, Publishing and High Performance Computing, Storage and File Systems (GPFS & Lustre) Management.

I hope you find my collections of thoughts useful. Send me a note, if you have any questions or if you would like to share your thoughts on my thoughts. :-)

Cheers...

What is this symbol used in my profile?

It represents one of the "unique" alphabets in the [Tamil language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) (one of the oldest surviving classical languages of the world) pronounced as "la" with "za" sound. It is a special 'distinguished' alphabet and pronunciation that's only found in the Tamil language (among the five languages that share a common ancestry). The Tamil language belongs to the [Dravidian family of languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages). I chose this alphabet to represent my Gravatar because it holds a special place for me.
