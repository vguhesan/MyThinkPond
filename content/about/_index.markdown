**Blog Mascot:** 
{{<img src="/img/common/owl-mascot.png" alt="Blog Mascot - Owl" width="50" align="center" class="imgframe">}} **Mr.Owl** 

Owls are considered to be one of the most mysterious of all birds. They are believed to be part of the spirit world that brings both men and the gods together as one. Greek mythology often talks about the goddess Athena who was an owl. Athena is talked about in a good light with the ideals of art, wisdom, beauty, and skillfulness. In some other cultures, owls represent as keepers of wisdom and knowledge and so I felt that Mr.Owl suits best to be the mascot of this website (as the "keeper of the knowledge contained within My-Think-Pond") So as you bookmark this website and when you revisit - you will be reminded of Mr.Owl :-) (Mr.Owl is always hiding in plain sight between the lines in this blog - if you find him - wish him well!) 

## Places of Work / Contributions

There is a saying - _"If you want to measure a persons worth, measure the lives that they have touched!"_. Although, I truly cannot measure the lives that I have personally touched, I can indirectly measure the contributions I have made to humanity through my service over the years to the wonderful companies, organizations, and entities that I have had the privileged to work for. And the countless companies that have used my products and the services that I have helped shape over the years.

Below is a list of organizations that I have worked for:
(current & past - in no special order)<sup>*</sup>

- Federal Government
- Leidos
- Eliassien Group 
- Systems Alliance
- Random House Publishing / Penguin Random House
- United States Fidelity & Guarantee Company (USF&G) / St. Paul / Travelers Insurance Company
- T. Rowe Price Investments, Inc.
- Cap Gemini Group / Ernst & Young / Sogeti
- Rewards Plus of America / Hewitt / Aon-Hewitt / Aon
- DrFirst
- Campus Book Hound
- Advanced Ticketing and Management System / ASC Tickets
- Secure Stax
- Data Direct Networks

During COVID-19 (which everyone in my generation in this century will remember for sure), I began to realize how small and fragile we are in this universe. So whenever I needed a little motivation, I look to this wall for inspiration! I call it: "My Wall of Motivation":
